# SL_FL_survey
A incomplete survey for Split Learning (comprehensive enough) and Federated Learning (only most representative works)

## Split Learning Schemes

### Original Split Learning

2. [Split learning for health: Distributed deep learning
without sharing raw patient data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00564.pdf)

### Split Federated Learning
1. [SplitFed: When Federated Learning Meets Split Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12088)


## Evaluation Work
